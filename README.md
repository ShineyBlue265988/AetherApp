## Heads up

The current version is a developer preview. It collects usage metrics to help debugging. 

This is a developer preview, a pre-alpha. It is unstable and untested. It is not production-ready.

## Download 
[Download Aether](https://getaether.net)

Aether is available for Mac OS, Windows and Linux. Our community supports Windows, Mac OS and Linux versions at [meta.geteather.net](https://meta.getaether.net/c/support). 

## Compiling

Aether is a relatively large app with an Electron and Go toolchain, at 100,000+ lines of code. Getting it to compile requires setting up a correct build runtime with the latest versions of Go, Node (for Electron) and C dependencies and development environments. Expect the initial set-up to take a few hours. Be patient! ðŸ™‚

### Instructions 
Compile instructions can be found here on this [gist](https://gist.github.com/nehbit/4a8c3d81d543e85c9df974f521732b1e), and at [getaether.net/docs/developers](https://getaether.net/docs/developers/).

## Filing a bug

Please create a topic in the appropriate section of [meta.getaether.net](https://meta.getaether.net). This allows the non-Github-using majority of Aether users to help with your issue, and point you in the right direction.
